## Project Description
Classification in machine learning and statistics is a supervised learning approach in which the computer program learns from the data given to it and makes new observations or classifications. The main goal is to identify which class/category the new data will fall into. 

## Objectives of Project
1. Learn more about classification models and help the client, a telecommunication company, to understand their data.
2. Find the lifetime value of each customer.
know what factors affect the rate at which customers stop using their network.
3. Predict if a customer will churn or not

## Goal of Project
To analyse customer churn rate and build classification models to perform churn analysis on a telecommunication company's customers

## Data
The datasets where extracted from three(3) places. 

* First dataset - First 3000 records of the dataset was extracted from Microsoft SQL Server
* Second dataset - The second 2000 records of the dataset was downloaded from OneDrive
* Third dataset - The third part of the data was downloaded from a GitHub Repository

## Hypothesis
* H_o: Contract type does not influence customer Churn
* H_a: Contract type influences customer Churn

### Conclusion on hypothesis
Test hypotheis with a chi-square test, we reject the null hypothesis at 5% significance value. 

## Research Questions

1. How does gender impact customer churn? Are there significant differences in churn rates between male and female customers?

2. Does the presence of a partner or dependents influence customer churn? Is there a relationship between marital status and churn behavior?

3. How does the length of tenure affect churn rates? Are customers with longer tenures less likely to churn compared to new customers?


4. What role do additional services (e.g., online security, tech support, streaming TV, etc.) play in reducing customer churn? Are customers with more services less likely to churn?

5. Is there a correlation between the contract term (month-to-month, one year, two years) and churn rates? Are customers on long-term contracts less likely to churn compared to those on month-to-monthÂ contracts?
